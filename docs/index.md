# Pyxations Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Pyxations**, a Python package for handling and analyzing eye-tracking data.

# Features

- **BIDS Conversion**: Convert your dataset to BIDS format, automatically organizing files according to BIDS standards.
- **EDF to ASCII Conversion**: Convert EDF files to ASCII format using `edf2asc`, a tool provided by EyeLink.
- **EDF Parsing**: Parse EDF files generated by the EyeLink system to extract various data structures, including header information, messages, calibration data, events, and raw samples.
- **Trial Segmentation**: Segment continuous eye-tracking data into trials using flexible methods, including start/end messages, fixed durations, or explicit start/end times.
- **Derivative Computation**: Compute derivatives for a dataset by parsing EDF files and storing the results in an organized manner.
- **Processing Derivatives**: Process the derivatives by performing eye movement detection, classifying saccades, splitting them into trials, and visualizing the results.
- **Eye Movement Detection**: Detect fixations and saccades using multiple algorithms like REMoDNaV, Engbert–Kliegl, among others.
- **Saccades Direction Classification**: Classify saccades based on their start and end coordinates into four primary directions: right, left, up, and down.
